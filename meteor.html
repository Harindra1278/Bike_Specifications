        <p style="font-size: 30px ;text-justify: auto; color: cornsilk;">The Meteor is an Indian Cruiser-style motorcycle manufactured by Royal Enfield in India. The model was developed by engineers based at Royal Enfield’s two state-of-the-art technical centres, in Chennai. The Meteor is a direct replacement to Thunderbird 350.

            Design
            Engine
            Royal Enfield developed the Meteor codenamed JD1.[1] The 349cc long-stroke single-cylinder engine is now air and oil-cooled and the traditional pushrods were replaced by an overhead cam. The engine produces 20 horsepower at 6,100rpm and 27Nm of torque at 4,000rpm and is paired to a five-speed constant mesh transmission. The bike has a power-to-weight ratio of 105.75 hp/tonne. The engine design also includes a balancer shaft to repress the vibrations.[2]The Royal Enfield Meteor 350 has a fuel consumption of around 35 km/l.
            
            Frame and Chassis
            The Meteor comes with a twin-tube spine frame, as opposed to the single downtube frame, which most of its contemporaries in the company's line-up have. The suspension is telescopic in front while in the rear is twin-tube emulsion shock absorbers. Front forks are 41mm with 130mm travel and the rear suspension has six-step adjustable preload.
            
            The stock tires of the bike are 100/90-19 inch at front and 140/70-17 inch at the rear. The motorcycle has a 300 mm disc with a dual-piston floating caliper at the front and a 270 mm single-piston floating caliper disc at rear.[citation needed]
            
            The bike also features an all-new semi-digital instrument cluster and a tripper screen in a separate pod which displays turn by turn navigation.[3]
            
            2022 Update
            Three new colors are available.[4]
            
            In July 2022, it starts at an ex-showroom price of ₹205,844 (US$2,600) in India.[5] In Germany, it starts at €4,390 (US$5,192.05).[6]</p>
